# Getting Started

To start using the `pnp-hugo-theme`:

1. Add the repository into your Hugo Project repository as a submodule, `git submodule add https://github.com/pnp/pnp-hugo-theme.git themes/pnp-hugo-theme`.
2. Configure your `config.toml`. You can use [this minimal configuration](https://github.com/pnp/pnp-hugo-theme/blob/main/docs/configurations.md#complete-example) as a base. The [`config.toml`](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) inside the [exampleSite](https://github.com/pnp/pnp-hugo-theme/tree/main/exampleSite) from the `exampleSite` is also a good reference.
3. Build your site with `hugo serve` and see the result at `http://localhost:1313/`.

You can also clone or download it, then run these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/pnp/pnp-hugo-theme.git

cd pnp-hugo-theme

npm install

npm run build
```

You'll see the result at [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).
